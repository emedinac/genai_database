# genai_database
 A growing collection of hands-on projects pushing the boundaries of GenAI: covering LLMs, agents, RAG variants, multimodal systems, and general generative models. Built to explore, test, and create at the edge of whatâ€™s possible.

## Why These Projects?
Over the past few months, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the world of LLMs, agents, multimodal models, and tool integration, exploring different frameworks. To deepen my understanding and experiment with real-world applications, Iâ€™m building a series of practical, domain-specific systems ðŸ˜ƒ

| 1            | A fully offline system leveraging Ollama to run local LLMs for experimenting with prompt engineering techniques, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency on answering finance-related questions, particularly around stock market data and trends. This tool is designed for fast iteration, performance benchmarking, and analysis of prompt effectiveness in a domain where precision matters. Includes interactive parameter tuning (for the LLM and metrics), metrics visualization, and an experimentation workflow.   | LLMs, zero/few-shot (CoT,  Self-Consistency) propmt engineering, Gradio, Ollama, BeautifulSoup, Huggingface    | [View](https://github.com/emedinac/BenchmarkAndPromptOptimization) |
